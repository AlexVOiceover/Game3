# Gyro Spy

This game was built as part of my aplication for the Founders and Coders course. I had already the different pieces of the puzzle, just needed to shape them if a game.
Founders and coders is about communication, how information flows between people, and when someone is generous with sharing their knowledge the cycle comes back at some point in unespected ways.
My game had to be cooperative, communication is an effort of two, if someone fails the mission is lost.
I also wanted to have a heavy pressence of audio, both as soundtracks and FX sounds. The last piece was to use the phone itself as the game devices, the interceptor and the decoder. Being able to use the gyro of the phone was essencial to fulfill with the vision of this game.

The game will work only on Android phones. Since I need to acces to some resources of the devices the security on iPhones won't allow me to impmlement the game withput a huge effort in rewriting the code.

works better with the phone horizontal that with the phone in vertical position. The game uses the gyros x and y, even if it admits some deviation in angle it will lose accuracy. A possible extra could be to ask how the user is going to position the phone and use gyros x and z if vertical.
The interceptor will reset the gyro when activated but you need to reset it just press the green calibration button on the top.


Gyro Spy is a cooperative, communication-based game built as part of my application for the Founders and Coders course. The game utilizes the gyro of the phone, giving it a unique, interactive element. It's designed to work on Android phones due to the need to access certain device resources.

## Introduction

This game was built to showcase the importance of communication and how information flows between people. Just like in Founders and Coders, sharing knowledge generously can lead to unexpected and rewarding outcomes. In Gyro Spy, if one player fails, the mission is lost - emphasizing the need for teamwork and cooperation.

The game heavily incorporates audio, both as soundtracks and FX sounds, adding another layer of immersion. The devices used in the game are the interceptor and the decoder, with the phone's gyro being an essential component to fulfill the vision of this game.

It's recommended to play the game with the phone in a horizontal position for better accuracy, even though it admits some deviation in angle. A possible extra could be to ask how the user is going to position the phone and use gyros x and z if vertical. The interceptor will reset the gyro when activated but if you need to reset it just press the green calibration button on the top.


# Interceptor and Decoder Game

This is an interactive game where players can take on the roles of an "Interceptor" or a "Decoder". The game is designed to be played on Android phones.

## Gameplay

Players select their role by touching the left or right side of the screen. The roles are:

- **Interceptor**: The player's task is to use their device's gyro to capture enemy signals. Each capture triggers a Morse code. The player must have their assistant decode this on their device. Once the global scan finishes, the player inputs the decoded characters and hits "Verify Code".

- **Decoder**: The player listens carefully to the Morse code signals and decrypts them by tapping on their device. Once the global scan is complete, the player passes the characters to the interceptor.
