# Codebreakers

## Introduction

This game was built to showcase the importance of communication and how information flows between people. Just like in Founders and Coders, sharing knowledge generously can lead to unexpected and rewarding outcomes. In Codebreakers, if one player fails, the mission is lost - emphasizing the need for teamwork and cooperation.

The game heavily incorporates audio, both as soundtracks and FX sounds, adding another layer of immersion. I also wanted to use special features of the phone that we have access to just with simple Javascript, like the gyroscopes.

The game is designed to be played on Android phones. Regading iPhones, since they have a different security policies it would take a huge effort to replicate the whole code to make it run on IOS. Personally I see this project as an educational workshop, so I am not planning to adapt it in the near future.

In the same way it won't work on a PC. I really wanted the user to feel like their phone transforms in a different device, a portable signal interceptor and a morse decoder. Using the mouse to capture the signal could work, but this goes completely out of the vision that I got for this game.

# Interceptor and Decoder roles

This is an interactive game where players can take on the roles of an "Interceptor" or a "Decoder", but you really need someone to play with you to experience the whole thing.
I added a cheatmode on the interceptor screen; by tapping 5 times on the build number it will show you the characters of the captured signals. This is only for testing purposes, the real fun is having someone else doins the decoding and feeling the rush of the time passing fast.

- **Interceptor**: The player's task is to use their device's gyro to capture enemy signals. Each capture triggers a Morse code. The player must have their assistant decode this on their device. Once the global scan finishes, the player inputs the decoded characters and hits "Verify Code".

- **Decoder**: The player listens carefully to the Morse code signals and decrypts them by tapping on their device. Once the global scan is complete, the decoder passes the characters to the interceptor, and this one will veryfy them.

# Codebreakers

## Overview
Codebreakers is an immersive, interactive game that underscores the importance of communication and the flow of information between individuals. The game is inspired by the ethos of Founders and Coders, where the generous sharing of knowledge often leads to unexpected and rewarding outcomes. In Codebreakers, the success of the mission is dependent on both player's cooperation.

## Features
..* Audio Integration: The game extensively incorporates audio elements, including soundtracks and FX sounds, to enhance the immersive experience.
..* Smartphone Features: The game leverages the special features of smartphones, such as gyroscopes, accessible through simple JavaScript.
..* Interceptor and Decoder Roles: Codebreakers is an interactive game where players can assume the roles of an "Interceptor" or a "Decoder". However, to fully experience the game, it is best played with a partner.

## Compatibility
Codebreakers is primarily designed for Android phones. Due to the distinct security policies of iPhones, adapting the game for iOS would require substantial effort. As this project is primarily an educational endeavor, there are currently no plans to make it iOS compatible. Similarly, it won't work on a PC. I really wanted users to feel as if their phone transforms into a different device, a portable signal interceptor and a Morse decoder. Using a mouse to capture the signal could work, but this deviates completely from the vision I have for this game.

## Roles
Interceptor: The player's task is to use their device's gyro to capture enemy signals. Each capture triggers a Morse code. The player must have their assistant decode this on their device. Once the global scan finishes, the player inputs the decoded characters and hits "Verify Code".
Decoder: The player listens carefully to the Morse code signals and decrypts them by tapping on their device. Once the global scan is complete, the decoder passes the characters to the interceptor for verification.

## Cheat Mode
A cheat mode is available on the interceptor screen for testing purposes. By tapping the build number five times, the characters of the captured signals are revealed. However, the real thrill of the game lies in having another player decode the signals as time ticks away.
