# Codebreakers

## Introduction

This game was built to showcase the importance of communication and how information flows between people. Just like in Founders and Coders, sharing knowledge generously can lead to unexpected and rewarding outcomes. In Gyro Spy, if one player fails, the mission is lost - emphasizing the need for teamwork and cooperation.

The game heavily incorporates audio, both as soundtracks and FX sounds, adding another layer of immersion. The devices used in the game are the interceptor and the decoder, with the phone's gyro being an essential component to fulfill the vision of this game.

It's recommended to play the game with the phone in a horizontal position for better accuracy, even though it admits some deviation in angle. A possible extra could be to ask how the user is going to position the phone and use gyros x and z if vertical. The interceptor will reset the gyro when activated but if you need to reset it just press the green calibration button on the top.


# Interceptor and Decoder Game

This is an interactive game where players can take on the roles of an "Interceptor" or a "Decoder". The game is designed to be played on Android phones.

## Gameplay

Players select their role by touching the left or right side of the screen. The roles are:

- **Interceptor**: The player's task is to use their device's gyro to capture enemy signals. Each capture triggers a Morse code. The player must have their assistant decode this on their device. Once the global scan finishes, the player inputs the decoded characters and hits "Verify Code".

- **Decoder**: The player listens carefully to the Morse code signals and decrypts them by tapping on their device. Once the global scan is complete, the player passes the characters to the interceptor.
