works better with the phone horizontal that with the phone in vertical position. The game uses the gyros x and y, even if it admits some deviation in angle it will lose accuracy. A possible extra could be to ask how the user is going to position the phone and use gyros x and z if vertical.


# Interceptor and Decoder Game

This is an interactive game where players can take on the roles of an "Interceptor" or a "Decoder". The game is designed to be played on Android phones.

## Gameplay

Players select their role by touching the left or right side of the screen. The roles are:

- **Interceptor**: The player's task is to use their device's gyro to capture enemy signals. Each capture triggers a Morse code. The player must have their assistant decode this on their device. Once the global scan finishes, the player inputs the decoded characters and hits "Verify Code".

- **Decoder**: The player listens carefully to the Morse code signals and decrypts them by tapping on their device. Once the global scan is complete, the player passes the characters to the interceptor.
