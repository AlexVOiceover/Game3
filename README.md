# Gyro Spy

The game wont work on 
works better with the phone horizontal that with the phone in vertical position. The game uses the gyros x and y, even if it admits some deviation in angle it will lose accuracy. A possible extra could be to ask how the user is going to position the phone and use gyros x and z if vertical.
